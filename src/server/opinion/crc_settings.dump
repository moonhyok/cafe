Press the buttons to assign grades to these 6 issues facing California (click the skip button for issues where you don\'t want to assign a grade.)           <br/><br/>           <em>Q:</em> How can I learn more about the six issues we are grading?<br/>           <em>A:</em> Here is an overview of each issue:<br/><br/>                      <div> <em>Implementation of the Affordable Care Act (\'Obamacare\')</em><br/>  \r\n              California was the first state to pass legislation creating a health insurance marketplace--Covered California. As of Dec 2013, Covered California had over 630,000 enrollees.<br/><br/> \r\n              <em>Quality of K-12 public education</em><br/> \r\n              California recently adopted the \\\"common core\\\" challenges, which emphasize critical thinking and analysis in K-12 education to better prepare students for college and the workforce.<br/><br/> \\ \r\n\r\n              <em>Affordability of state colleges and universities</em><br/>                             The 2014-15 draft California budget calls for a 10.8% increase in higher education funding, which could keep current tuition costs stable.<br/><br/> \r\n              <em>Access to state services for undocumented immigrants</em><br/>                             Passed in 2006, California Senate Bill 1569 extends eligibility for undocumented immigrants in California for food assistance, supplemental security income, and health insurance.               Passed in 2011, The California Dream Act grants undocumented immigrant access to state aid at public universities and colleges.<br/><br/> \r\n              <em>Laws and regulations regarding recreational marijuana</em><br/> \r\n              California was the first state to legalize the distribution of medical marijuana in 1996.               Recreational use of marijuana is illegal in the State of California. However, California lawmakers are currently considering legalizing, taxing, and regulating marijuana for recreational use.<br/><br/> \r\n              <em>Marriage rights for same-sex partners</em><br/> \r\n              California legalized same sex marriage in 2008. However, Proposition 8, which revoked marriage rights for same sex couples, was also passed in 2008.               Proposition 8 was overturned in 2013.<br/><br/>           </div> \r\n          More information on the issues is available on our project website.<br/><br/> \r\n          <em>Q:</em> Do I have to grade all issues?<br/>           <em>A:</em> No, just click the skip button for issues where you don\'t want to assign a grade.<br/><br/> \r\n          <em>Q:</em> Why do the sliders require dragging?  If I tap on A, it should go there.<br/>           <em>A:</em> We decided to remove the tap feature since as you slide down to see more issues you may accidentally tap the sliders.<br/><br/> \r\n          <em>Q:</em> How can I grade K-12 Education when there are so many aspects, the effectiveness of the teachers, or the quality of school facilities, etc.?<br/>           <em>A:</em> That\'s a great point; we\'re asking people to give an overall grade, which is indeed a coarse measure!           But it\'s also like grading a student for a class, they may have done well on some things, poorly on others, etc...<br/><br/>','2014-09-08 12:00:32'),(2,'HELP_CAFE_LOGOUT_OR_CONTINUE','You can either log out now and return anytime using the unique link we emailed you.

Think of each issue as one dimension of a 6-dimensional space.           The grades you assign define a point in this space.            We use dimensionality reduction (currently Principal Component Analysis) to project that space onto the table.           If you and another participant assigned very similar grades, your mugs will be close together.          Mugs that are distant from yours belong to participants who graded very differently than you.<br/><br/>           <em>Q:</em> Why do I only see 8-10 mugs arranged on the table?<br/>           <em>A:</em> To avoid overcrowding, we display only a few mugs at a time for grading.           The selection of which participants\' mugs to display is random but biased toward newer mugs, those that have received fewer ratings.           Specifically, the likelihood of displaying a mug is based on its standard error = stdev / sqrt(k) where k is the number of times it has been graded so far, and stdev is the variance of those grades. Over time, this ensures that the confidence, or error-bar on the estimated grade for each mug, tends to be the same length for all mugs. Each time you finish grading a set of mugs, the table will be refreshed with more mugs.<br/><br/>','2014-09-08 12:00:32'),(7,'SCORE_DIALOG_TEXT','You earn points by rating others and when others rate your idea.
