Modelled after a Thread in Java; you can instantiate algorithms with data, and call them from a run method. They are also independent of the calculator and can be parallelized.
Need a dataset, which can be specified for the Algorithm. This makes it easy to add more Algorithms.
All algorithms can extend Algorithm.

REQUIRED:
runAlgorithm() which runs the algorithm on the dataset. This can call other methods.

class Algorithm(object):

	def runAlgorithm(self):
