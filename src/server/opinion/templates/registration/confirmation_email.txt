Thanks for participating in the California Report Card v1.0! 
We promise not to deluge you with emails and will not share your email
with third parties (you can opt out at any time: see bottom of page).

Here is your unique link that will let you login to continue to

Please save this link.  You can use it anytime to view updates on the
data collected so far to check your "Participation Score", which
increases as you grade the issues others have suggested (100 points
for each), and when others grade the issue you suggested (up to 20,000
points).  Participants with the highest scores will be eligible to be
invited to meet with Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Professor Ken Goldberg,
and the CRC team at UC Berkeley on 20 March 2014 to discuss the
data and lessons learned from version 1.0 and the most important
issues for version 2.0.

Thanks again for participating!
