  "The California Report Card is a new way for me to keep an ear to the
  ground. I'm working with Ken Goldberg and his research team at UC
  Berkeley to develop a platform that lets Californians use their cell
  phones to advise me on state priorities.  This new app/website makes it
  easy to assign grades to timely issues and suggest new ones that merit
  further attention.  In the first few weeks, participants are conveying
  that they approve of our rollout of Obamacare but are very concerned
  about the future of California schools and universities. I'm also
  hearing insights from Californians on issues ranging from fracking to
  pension reform.  On Mar 20, 3-5pm, I'll be at UC Berkeley for an open
  forum to discuss what we're learning and what we can do next."
