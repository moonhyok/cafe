Dear CS169.2x student,

Now that you've completed the first week of lectures and the first assignment, we've created a unique link to make it easy for you to quickly update your course evaluation.  We're hoping you'll return each week for two minutes to share your perspectives, which will help us understand how students are progressing so that we can improve the course!  Just click:
