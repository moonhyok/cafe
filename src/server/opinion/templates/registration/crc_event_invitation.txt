Thank you for participating in the California Report Card Project!

Since the "California Report Card" launched in early February, over
6000 people from almost every county have assigned over 20,000 grades
to the State of California and suggested issues for the next report
card.  This feedback is being closely watched by Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom.

Two updates:

1)  This Thursday, 20 March, we will host a public forum on the California 
Report Card: Learning from a New Platform for Civic Engagement, 3-5pm, at 
UC Berkeley. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom and Prof. Ken Goldberg will be 
joined by Dr. Marina Gorbis, Director of the Institute of the Future Director,
and Prof. Henry Brady, Dean of the Goldman School of Public Policy to host
a public forum at UC Berkeley on 20 March 2014 to review the data and 
lessons learned. It's Free and Open to the Public.  
Please register at: http://j.mp/CRC-20-March-Event

2) To help others grade the issues suggested by participants,
we made a light edit to the wording of suggestions.  
The issue that you suggested for the next Report Card now reads as follows:

{% autoescape off %}
{{comment}}
{% endautoescape %}

If you would like a change in this wording, please contact Project Manager
Dr. Brandie Martin Nonnecke <nonnecke@citris-uc.org>.

{{received}} Californians have graded your suggestion so far!
