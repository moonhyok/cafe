CAFE: The Collective Assesment and Feedback Engine
====
With USAID and the Development Impact Lab at UC Berkeley, the CITRIS
Data and Democracy Initiative is developing a new social media
platform that directly engages citizens and communities from
developing regions to collectively assess conditions, needs, and
outcomes related to engineering innovations in humanitarian
assistance, solar energy, democracy and governance, and global health.

In contrast to polls and surveys that are extremely valuable for analysts, CAFÉ is user-facing: the CAFÉ platform will provide direct, immediate visual feedback to participants, allowing them to instantly understand where they stand on key issues with respect to other participants and encourage open-ended / qualitative responses that can enhance interaction between users. Like a coffeehouse, we envision CAFÉ as a grassroots, user-friendly, self-organizing environment that allows the wisdom of crowds to identify, highlight, and display patterns, trends, and insights as they emerge.  To facilitate interactions, CAFÉ will incorporate techniques from deliberative polling, collaborative filtering, and multidimensional visualization.

Opinion Space, a precursor to CAFÉ that focused on social innovation,
has been used since 2010 by the U.S. State Department.  Thousands of
participants from around the world use it to organize, visualize, and
analyze constructive suggestions on foreign policy:

"Opinion Space will harness the power of connection technologies to provide
a unique forum for international dialogue. This is...an opportunity to
extend our engagement beyond the halls of government directly to the people
of the world."  - U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 2010

An example of the Opinion Space interface is below, our goal is to
design and create new interfaces and assessment tools, including those
that don't rely on smartphones or the internet for use in remote
communities:
